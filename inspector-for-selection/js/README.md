# JointJS+: Inspector for Selection (JavaScript)

The Inspector and Selection plugins of JointJS+ allow users to view and modify the data of multiple diagram elements simultaneously. The Inspector component evaluates the collection of selected elements and presents the most appropriate value for each property. If all elements have the same property value, it displays that value. If there are varying values, a dash appears in the input field. Properties not supported by any selected element are hidden in the Inspector. For instance, the "corner radius" property won't appear if an ellipse is selected. Any edited property value gets assigned to all currently selected elements.
