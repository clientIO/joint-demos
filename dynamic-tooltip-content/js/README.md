# JointJS+: Dynamic Tooltip Content (JavaScript)

This demo shows how to display the tooltip when you hover over a port. The tooltip shows various information about the port connection (what it is connected to and how) and the information is gathered on demand from the graph just before the tooltip is displayed.

## Running the application

To run this application you need to have access to JointJS+ package. You can get it by having a JointJS+ license or by starting a [free trial](https://www.jointjs.com/free-trial).

### Private npm registry

By default, this application uses JointJS+ from our private npm registry. This example assumes that you have already set up your npm to access JointJS+ package and put your authentication token in the `JOINTJS_NPM_TOKEN` environment variable.

Learn more about our [private npm registry here.](https://docs.jointjs.com/learn/help-center/npm-registry)

### Install dependencies

After setting up access to JointJS+ package, install the dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

And then start the application with:

```bash
npm run dev
```
