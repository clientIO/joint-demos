# JointJS+: Touch Gestures (JavaScript)

Have you been wondering how to implement touch gestures such as pan and pinch in your JointJS application? Explore this demo that shows how to use the Interact.js library to support panning and pinching gestures on touch devices, while keeping all other functionality intact. To see it in action, open the demo on a mobile device and experience it for yourself!

## Running the application

To run this application you need to have access to JointJS+ package. You can get it by having a JointJS+ license or by starting a [free trial](https://www.jointjs.com/free-trial).

### Private npm registry

By default, this application uses JointJS+ from our private npm registry. This example assumes that you have already set up your npm to access JointJS+ package and put your authentication token in the `JOINTJS_NPM_TOKEN` environment variable.

Learn more about our [private npm registry here.](https://docs.jointjs.com/learn/help-center/npm-registry)

### JointJS+ package from local path

If you don't have access to JointJS+ private npm registry but have it downloaded locally, you can install it from a local path by changing the `package.json` file. In that case, replace the line:

```json
    "@joint/plus": "^4.2.2",
```

with

```json
    "@joint/plus": "file:path-to-the-archive/joint-plus.tgz",
```

### Install dependencies

After setting up access to JointJS+ package, install the dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

And then start the application with:

```bash
npm run dev
```
